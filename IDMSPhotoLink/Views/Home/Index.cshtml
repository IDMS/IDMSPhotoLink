        IDMS PhotoLink demonstrates how to call REST Web Api from COBOL programs running on IDMS/DC.  There is a
        sample ADS dialog and COBOL program included as content.  When the dialog is used to display and employee,
        the employee's information is pushed to anyone who has DemoClientPage.html open.  The JavaScript on the page displays the employee's
        name and picture.

        <h2>Getting started with IDMS PhotoLink</h2>
        <p>
            This project offers web api services in support of a sample application.  The application demonstrates
            one way to call outside REST services from a COBOL program running under IDMS/DC.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than the web interfaces call by the COBOL program, the remainder of this site is merely a standard MVC 5
            web site generated by Visual Studio 2013.  The important source files to review are EmployeePicsController.cs and
            TopicService.cs.  The controller handles the POST and GET verbs and the TopicService encapulates
            an interface to Microsoft Azure Service Bus Topics. DemoClientPage.html is used to connect to the service.
            There is JavaScript there that continuously calls the GET method so it can responsively show updated 
            information.
